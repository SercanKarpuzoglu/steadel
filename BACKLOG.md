| # | Task | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | **Meta app application** — Marketing API access review | Sercan | ⏸ deferred 2026-07-20 (blocked: Facebook developer-account access issue). NOT on critical path — ads guard runs on MockMetaProvider/Beta; alerts + reports work without it. Revisit post-launch. |
| 12 | Uptime Kuma: 4 monitors (app/landing/pg/redis), Brevo email alerts, public status page at status.steadel.com | Both | ✅ 2026-07-19 |
| 13 | WooCommerce e2e — real store (WP+Woo on server), REST sync of 5 products, tracked→rule→stock change→low_stock+out_of_stock emails verified in inbox | Claude | ✅ 2026-07-20 |
| 14 | Storage Box offsite backup (script already supports BACKUP_SCP_TARGET) | Sercan decision | ⏸ deferred |

## P3 — Later

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 15 | Shopify `read_orders` protected-data approval → sales charts light up | after real merchants |
| 16 | "Steadel" trademark registration | legal, optional |
| 17 | EU-friendly analytics for marketing site only (e.g. Plausible) | app stays analytics-free per spec |
| 18 | Google Ads provider | explicitly v2 in SPEC §5.4 |
